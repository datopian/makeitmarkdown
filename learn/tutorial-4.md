## Introduction

In this tutorial, we will dive into the more technical aspects of website customisation, but this time, everything will be done locally. You'll learn how to preview your site on your own machine before pushing changes to the live site, ensuring everything looks and works exactly as you want.

By the end of this tutorial, you will:

- Understand how to preview your site locally.
- Know how to change your website's title and description.
- Learn how to customise your website's appearance using Tailwind themes.
- Understand how to configure the navbar, navigation links, and logo.
- Learn how to integrate Google Analytics into your website.
- Be aware of additional customisation options for deeper customisation.

## Previewing the site locally

- Navigate to your website's repository directory on your computer using command line
- Install the site's dependencies
- Start the local development server
- Visit the local address displayed in your command line. Yay! You can now preview your changes locally, live! ðŸŽ‰

## Changing the site title and description

## Configuring the title, description and navbar

- Open theÂ `content/config.mjs`Â file in your code editor
- Edit theÂ `title`Â andÂ `description`Â fields
- Edit the fields in theÂ `navbar`Â field to customise your navbar's title and logo. Then, add navigation links toÂ `navLinks`Â field (these will be displayed in the navbar). Save and refresh your local site to see the changes.

## Integrating with Google Analytics

- Still in theÂ `content/config.mjs`Â file, navigate to theÂ `analytics`Â field
