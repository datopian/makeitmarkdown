Welcome to Make it Markdown! Here you can learn how to build markdown-based websites, docs, knowledgebases and more ‚Äì and why a markdown-based approach is awesome ü¶∏‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

### What is Markdown?

[Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown)¬†is a lightweight markup language used to format text
- In WYSIWYG editors (e.g. Word), you click buttons to format text and the changes are immediately visible; in markdown you add syntax to the text to indicate how it should be formatted, e.g. `**xxx**` to indicate bold

### Why use Markdown? 

- **Markdown is simple and intuitive** - don't need to learn a lot of tags and commands, just use symbols to create headings, links, etc.
- **Markdown is portable and compatible** - files with markdown-formatted text can be opened and edited with virtually any text editor or application that supports plain text (which isn't the case with e.g. Word, which locks content into a proprietary file format). This means:
	- You can use it for everything (websites, documents, notes, knowledgebases, catalogs, books, technical documentation...)
	- Can share files with others without compatibility issues
- **Markdown is flexible and extensible** - you can customise Markdown to suit your needs.  There are different 'flavours' or extensions of Markdown that add more features or functionality (e.g. CommonMark and GFM)
	- **Markdown is platform-independent** - you can use it on any device running any operating system

### The MOGF approach

- In this guide we set out an approach for working with Markdown to publish content on the web that we term MOGF (Markdown + Obsidian + Git(Hub) + Flowershow)
- This combination or "stack" of tools is free and easy to use, and provides a number of advantages
- **[GitHub](https://github.com/)**¬†is a web-based interface that uses¬†[Git](https://git-scm.com/), the open source version control software that lets multiple people make separate changes to web pages at the same time. ([source](https://digital.gov/resources/an-introduction-github/))
- **[Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/)** is a note-taking software that operates on Markdown files 
	- It previews formatted text
	- Supports an extended version of Markdown that includes majority of elements from CommonMark and GFM, while also introducing its own unique features, like¬†[wiki-links](https://help.obsidian.md/Linking+notes+and+files/Internal+links)¬†or¬†[callouts](https://help.obsidian.md/Editing+and+formatting/Callouts).
	-  Using Obsidian gets around some of the limitations of using GitHub UI:
		- GitHub UI will only preview GitHub Flavoured Markdown. And while it's a majority of Markdown you would write, it won't be able to render Obsidian-only (or Flowershow-only) syntax elements, like callouts, wiki-links or inline table of contents
		- It also doesn't allow you to make changes (or to add) multiple files at once
- **[Flowershow](https://flowershow.app/)** is an open-source tool for easily converting markdown files into a website
		- Flowershow template is Obsidian-compatible, meaning it supports (or aims to support) all of the Obsidian Markdown features

### About this guide
- This series of tutorials will guide you through creating, editing, collaborating on and customising a website using the MOGF approach
- Let's get started! ['Start Now' button below]

# Tutorial 1: Create a website from scratch using Markdown and Flowershow

### 1. Introduction

- This is a tutorial for creating a website in markdown and published in Flowershow
- What you'll have by the end of this tutorial:
	- a working markdown-based website powered by Flowershow
	- be able to edit the text and add pages, all from an online interface without installing anything
- Screenshot of what the final result will look like

### 2. Prerequisites

- A GitHub account

### 3. Setting up a website

- Navigate to your Github account and create a new repository
- Give your repository a name
- Sign in to cloud.flowershow.app and create a new site (select repo created in step above)
- See your published website!

### 4. Editing a page on your website

- Navigate to the repository of your website on GitHub
- Navigate to the "content" folder
- Edit the "index.md" file
- Save your changes
- See your site getting rebuilt
- Preview your site after changes

### 5. Add a simple Markdown-based page
- Navigate to the "content" folder in your website's repository
- Create new file
- Write the content of the file
- Save your changes
- Preview your site after changes

### 6. What's next?
- Limitations of editing on GitHub UI - no offline working, adding multiple files, previewing markdown elements
- Using Obsidian to edit content locally on computer gets around these limitations

# Tutorial 2: Edit your Flowershow website locally on your computer using Obsidian

### 1. Introduction
- Recap - we have a markdown-based website on Flowershow which we have edited on GitHub
- Advantages of editing locally with Obsidian (see subsection 6 above)
- This tutorial walks you through editing website locally. By the end, you will learn how to:
	- clone repo on your computer
	- edit content with Obsidian
	- commit changes locally and push them back to the GitHub repo

### 2. Prerequisites
- A GitHub account
- Obsidian installed
- GitHub Desktop installed
- Tutorial 1 complete

### 3. Clone the GitHub repository on your computer
- Open GitHub Desktop app
- Click on "Clone a Repository from the Internet‚Ä¶"
- Select the repository you want to clone
- Choose where your repository should be saved
- Click "Clone" and wait for the process to complete

### 4. Edit your site in Obsidian
- Open Obsidian
- Open your repository's /content folder as vault
- Edit your site's content

### 5. Save and publish your changes
- Navigate to GitHub Desktop app
- Commit your changes
- Push your changes to the remote repository
- See updated site live!

### 6. What's next?
- What happens if more than one person want to make changes to the site?
- In next tutorial, we will learn how to create a new branch of the repository locally and then merge changes with the web version

# Tutorial 3: Collaborating with others on your website project

### 1. Introduction
- Recap
- In this tutorial, we will guide you through collaborating with others on the same website project using GitHub.
- By the end of this tutorial, you will:
	- Understand what a branch is and how to create one.
	- Understand what a pull request (PR) is and how to create one.
	- Learn how to review and merge a PR.
	- Know how to resolve conflicts if they arise.
	- Collaborate with others using GitHub, following best practices.

### 2. Create a new branch
- Navigate to your site's repository on GitHub
- Click on the 'Branch' dropdown menu, type a new branch name and press Enter
- Yay! You've created a new branch!

### 3. Make changes in the new branch
- Switch to the new branch in GitHub Desktop
- Open the /content folder of the repository in Obsidian
- Edit the about page
- Commit the changes in GitHub Desktop app and push them to the remote repository on GitHub

### 4. Create a pull request (PR)
- Go back to your site's repository on GitHub
- Click on 'New pull request'
- Select your branch from the dropdown menu
- Write a brief description of your changes, then click on 'Create pull request'
- Yay! Your changes are ready to be reviewed! 

### 5. Review and merge a pull request

- Open the newly created pull request
- Review the changes, add comments if necessary
- If everything is in order, click 'Merge pull request', then 'Confirm merge'
- Yay! You've merged your changes into the main branch!

### 6. Resolving conflicts
-  In case of conflicts between your changes and those on the main branch, GitHub will alert you
- Follow the on-screen instructions to resolve the conflicts and merge your changes

### 7. What's next?
